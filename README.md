# Nuntius — A Peripheral News Agent

Nuntius is the Final Bachelor Project for the major Industrial Design by Arthur Geel.  

## Abstract
Reaching younger audiences with modern news media is a challenge that has proven to be a challenge for a long time. Using automatic personalization of news through recommendation systems can increase visitor engagement and retention. Additionally, the use of subtle notifications can help foster news consumption rituals that lead to higher engagement rates. This paper describes the design process and evaluation of Nuntius: a tangible aggregator of news that uses peripheral interactions to subtly inform its users of the availability of relevant news.
